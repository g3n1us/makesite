## Why tabs?
## For people with visual impairments, tabs are easily set to be more easily distinguishable.
## Spaces are not.
## The best argument for using spaces is that they are more cross-platform compatible.
## This is something you can work around.
## Visual impairments aren't.
## Be a Good Samaritan and look out for the next developer who will be working on your code,
## and let their challenges be related only to coding itself. ðŸ˜‡
